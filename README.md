# Virtual Sommelier Application :wine_glass:
Project Description: This application serves novice / casual wine drinkers who would like assistance making informed purchases for occasions such as hosting a dinner party or buying a gift. It is not geared towards connoisseurs or collectors who have in-depth knowledge of wine or want to make purchases via the application. It helps the target audience achieve this goal by providing three main features: a quick search, an advanced search, and wine recommendations. It is supported by the Wine Reviews CSV dataset from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews, which we chose for its high usability score, large amount of content, and numerous upvotes. The graphical user interface was built with Java Swing.
